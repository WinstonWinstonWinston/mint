Molecular Interpolant using Neural Transporters (MINT)

TODO:

- Create an equivariance testing setup
- Create a forward/backward pass benchmarking code
- Include ability for multiple experiments during training
- Simplify yaml setup
- Create free energy calculation setup for given reaction coordinate
- Enable mirror interpolants.
